Hola! Native spanish speaker here from Mexico! 
I just published my first repositorie on GitHub all by the guidance of the wonderful coding learning program: The Odin Project.
Besides the setup of the repositorie itself, this lesson got me to properly use the basic HTML tags for text, lists, and the anchor one.
It got me excited when everything worked the way i wanted. A little bit of fear for the web development has been taken from me in this lesson.
